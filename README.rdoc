This app acts as a to-do list for school work! It also allows users to add subparts to their tasks. The specific functionality of this app is as follows: 

1) gems: Gems used in this app are omniauth-facebook (http://rubydoc.info/gems/omniauth-facebook/1.5.1/frames), bootstrap (http://rubydoc.info/gems/bootstrap-sass/3.0.3.0/frames), formtastic (http://rubydoc.info/gems/formtastic/2.2.1/frames) and formtastic-bootstrap (http://rubydoc.info/gems/formtastic-bootstrap/2.1.3/frames). This allows for creation of cool forms with shorter syntax as seen on the create task page. 

2) heroku addon: Sendgrid (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sendgrid) is used to send an email after each task is added

3) database/structures: This app has three databases: users, tasks (belongs_to user), part_lists (belongs_to tasks). 

4) validations: this app validates for email format, presence of important fields, course format

5) scopes: this app adds scope for the priorities of the subparts such that high priority tasks are at the top of the index, followed by medium and low priorities. 

6) javascript/jquery: this is used in the index pages such that different rows can be highlighted and the title can be hidden and made visible.
