The original table I created stored information about homework tasks, their course, and due day. The new table is for storing all the subparts of each homework. There is also a third table about restaurants and their ratings from last week's homework.

Issues and fixes: 

* part_list.task.course wouldn't work, fixed by adding a try clause
